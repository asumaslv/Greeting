# A few words to those graduating today

<!-- ## 起承転結の「起」-->

It's an honer to say a few words as a parent to those graduating today. 

First of all, congratulations on your graduation!

I'd like to thank the principal and teachers of the school, as well as those who came here to this wonderful graduation ceremony. 

<!-- ## こどもの成長 -->

Looking at the face of the children, though it may sound vanilla expression, I feel the first day of my child at this school, holding small hand six years ago, as if it was just yesterday. 

Now the child got much bigger, and so is the hands, which is now too big to hold. Looking at those children as seniors at XYZ school really fills my heart. 

As a matter of fact, I'm one of many who graduated from this school. I can still see the remnant of the library and classrooms as I used to see in the past. I wish that those who graduate today would have a wish to send thier kids to this very school. 

<!-- ## 卒業生への激励 -->

Although I'm well aware that shorter comments are always better, I'd still like to say a few words about what I leaned in my life about the importance of self-affirmation. 
The word self-affirmation might not sound too familiar to many of you. But all it is saying is simply that you feel "your existence is important and precious". 

- You're content with who you are, 
- You like how you are, 
- You acknowledge something good within yourself. 

Sadly, [study](http://www.kantei.go.jp/jp/singi/kyouikusaisei/chousakai/dai1/siryou4.pdf) shows that the level of self-affirmation is substantially lower in Japan compared to other countries. 

Are you happy with who you are?

If you're happy with who you are, please raise your hand. 

Majority with hands raised:

　As you raised your hands, you're great people, because..
```

Minority with hands raised:

```text only
　I presume you're being shy, because..
```

- たくさんの人が見ていた国際通りでの市民演芸・民俗伝統芸能パレードで堂々と踊っていた様子はとてもかっこよかった。
- 運動会での 「ちゅらかーぎー、ちゅらかーぎー 1人飛ばして ちゅらかーぎー」のネタも大笑いしました。
- 学習発表会での劇で、見ていた人たちを感動で包んだ君たちは素晴らしい。この学年から役者デビューする子がいるのは間違いないでしょう。
- そして、なにより、日々の学校生活を素晴らしいものにするために協力した君たちの団結力は素晴らしい

You are great kids with great potentials. I am truly happy to be your parent and am very proud of you. 
Likewise, you should all be proud of yourselves, who you are and what you've accomplished. 

<!-- ## 先生、地域の皆様への感謝 -->

I do not even know how to thank enough by words to the teachers and those in the community. 
You have nurtured their personality, developed their enthusiasm; you can see how cheerful our children have become. 
Most importantly, they've gained many memories and friends in the school. I'd like to express my uthost appreciation.

<!-- ## 結び -->

Those who are graduating today still have a lot to learn. 
We may still need further guidance from the teachers, even after the graduation today. I'd like to ask you for your further assistance. 
Furthermore, I would like to ask those parents to retain our ties, even our children are in middle schools and high schools. 

To those graduating today; even if you'd be going to different classes and to different schools, please do not forget your friends you made in this school 
You all have futures with great potentials ahead of you. 

I'd like to conclude by wishing all of you here today to have wonderful lives.
